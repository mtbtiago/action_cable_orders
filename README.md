# Action Cable Orders
Sample project for my testings. It covers:
* Rails 5
* Action cable
* [Zurb Foundation CSS Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/)

## Roles

### Cook
In a fast food restaurant, you as a cook, have an eye on /orders form. Every time a new customer post an order with his/her phone, orders form is updated. When an order is ready to service, you click on serviced button and order disappears, while a notification is sent to the customer.

### Customer
You enter at the restaurant, grab the root url and an 'enter new order' form is displayed in your phone. You put your name, pick the goods you want to eat and click on sent button. That’s it! When your order is ready, you’ll receive a notification in your phone, while it also vibrates.
